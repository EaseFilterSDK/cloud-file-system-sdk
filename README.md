# EaseFilter Cloud File System SDK
## What is a cloud file system
A cloud file system is a hierarchical storage system in the cloud that provides shared access to file data. Users can create, delete, modify, read, and write cloud files as regular physical files, as well as organize them logically in local directory for intuitive access.

EaseFilter Cloud File System SDK allows you to implement the cloud disaster recovery (Cloud DR) solution, to seamlessly integrate your existing applications to the cloud environment without affecting the original data and programs, without any modification of your existing applications. It can help the small to medium size companies to implement the Cloud DR with the lowest cost and minimal disruption to normal operation.

## Cloud-Based Disaster Recovery
Cloud-based Disaster Recovery (Cloud DR) takes a very different approach for disaster recovery based on virtualization. EaseFilter Cloud File System automatically integrates the cloud storage into the on-premies storage, it can deliver a fully functional virtual infrastructure ready to take over an outage disrupt primary services. The virtual file is stored in an offsite public cloud where it remains in standby ready for failover. Data synchronization operates in the background to keep data up-to-date. The entire system can be spun up in minutes, saving the organization from costly service interruption.

Active-Active Cluster system. With the Cloud File File System, you can set up two or more active systems, which the virtual files can be accessed from all the active systems, it can distribute your load balance and support the automated fail over without your interference.

Zero downtime for the disaster recovery. With the Cloud File DR solution, in the event of a disaster, you can automatically fail over the local storage to the cloud storage if disaster strikes,you can quickly launch resources to ensure your business continuity. You can leverage for your disaster recovery (DR) processes to significantly minimize the impact on your data, your system, and your overall business operations, your business won't be interrupted. Retrieve back the files from cloud storage is very fast, only the applications requested data will be downloaded.
